# transposeTwoStrings
//You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.

//e.g. transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);

//should return:
//H W  
//e o  
//l r  
//l l  
//o d
